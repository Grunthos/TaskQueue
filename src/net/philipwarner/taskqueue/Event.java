/**
 * Base class for capturing and storing exceptions that occur during task processing but which
 * do not prevent the task from completing. Examples might include a long running export job
 * in which 3 items fail, but 1000 succeeed -- in this case it is useful to export the successful
 * ones and report the failures later.
 * 
 * The Task object has a 'saveException()' method that stores the exception in the database
 * for later retrieval.
 * 
 * Client applications should consider subclassing this object.
